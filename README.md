# Quick start guides
The guides in this repo represent example code given to developers to help jumpstart their adoption of IoT Core in their systems.

It has been and is used in conference talks, blogs and is intended as a step by step guide to getting IoT devices (specifically Raspberry PI) systems up and running on the Google Cloud Platform.

While my default hardware is Raspberry PI and an Adafruit Sense HAT, and code is Python, the logic should be helpful in illustrating all the pieces needed in order to get you up on your feet quickly.

They are designed to be consumed in conjunction with the blog posts I've written explaining the pieces as they go, but are straightforward enough that they can likely be consumed without much further explanation.
